                    <h3>Why This Topic Matters</h3>
                    <p>Growing up across three different countries—Germany, Qatar, and with roots tracing back to Afghanistan through Saudi Arabia—I've often found myself questioning where I truly belong. This project represents my attempt to understand the cultural threads that connect me to my Afghan heritage, despite never having lived in Afghanistan itself.</p>
                    <p>The journey of my family—from Afghanistan to Saudi Arabia, and then my own experience moving from Germany to Qatar—has created a complex cultural identity that I want to explore and document.</p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h3>How Living Abroad Affects My Identity</h3>
                    <p>Living outside Afghanistan has created a unique challenge: I feel connected to Afghan culture through my family, yet disconnected because I've never experienced life in Afghanistan directly. In Germany, I was often seen as "the Afghan kid," but I didn't fully understand what that meant. In Qatar, surrounded by a diverse international community, I've had to actively seek out and preserve my cultural identity rather than having it naturally reinforced by my environment.</p>

                    <h3>What I'm Afraid of Losing</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The language—especially the nuanced expressions and cultural meanings that don't translate</li>
                        <li>Traditional values like hospitality (mehman nawazi) and respect for elders</li>
                        <li>Family stories and oral history that connect me to my ancestors</li>
                        <li>The sense of belonging to a community with shared cultural practices</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h3>What I Want to Preserve</h3>
                    <p>I want to preserve the core values my grandparents and parents have passed down: the importance of family, the tradition of gathering for meals, the respect for our language, and the stories that make our family history unique. Most importantly, I want to understand these elements deeply enough that I can pass them on to future generations, even if I continue living outside Afghanistan.</p>
