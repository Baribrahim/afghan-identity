                    <h3>Why This Topic Matters</h3>
                    <p>I grew up in three different countries. I lived in Germany, then moved to Qatar. My family comes from Afghanistan, but my parents grew up in Saudi Arabia. I often ask myself where I really belong. This project helps me understand how I am connected to my Afghan heritage, even though I never lived in Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>My family moved from Afghanistan to Saudi Arabia. Then I moved from Germany to Qatar. This created a mixed cultural identity that I want to explore and write about.</p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h3>How Living Abroad Affects My Identity</h3>
                    <p>Living outside Afghanistan is difficult for me. I feel connected to Afghan culture through my family, but I also feel disconnected because I never experienced life in Afghanistan myself. In Germany, people called me "the Afghan kid," but I did not really understand what that meant. In Qatar, I am in an international community with many different cultures. I have to work hard to keep my Afghan identity, instead of learning it naturally from my environment.</p>

                    <h3>What I Am Afraid of Losing</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The language, especially words and expressions that do not translate well to English</li>
                        <li>Traditional values like hospitality (mehman nawazi) and respect for older people</li>
                        <li>Family stories that connect me to my ancestors</li>
                        <li>The feeling of belonging to a community with the same cultural practices</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h3>What I Want to Preserve</h3>
                    <p>I want to keep the important values that my grandparents and parents taught me. These include the importance of family, eating meals together, respecting our language, and the stories that make our family history special. Most importantly, I want to understand these things well enough so I can teach them to my children one day, even if I continue living outside Afghanistan.</p>
