                    <h3>Challenges in Preserving Afghan Identity</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Language Loss:</strong> Maintaining fluency in Dari while being more comfortable in English and German</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited Community:</strong> Small Afghan community in Qatar compared to what might exist in Afghanistan or larger diaspora communities</li>
                        <li><strong>Cultural Knowledge Gaps:</strong> Missing context about traditions, history, and cultural nuances that come from living in the culture</li>
                        <li><strong>Balancing Multiple Identities:</strong> Being Afghan, but also German-educated, living in Qatar, with Saudi-influenced family experiences</li>
                        <li><strong>Generational Differences:</strong> My understanding of Afghan culture differs from my grandparents' direct experience</li>

                    <h3>Moments of Cultural Conflict or Confusion</h3>
                    <p><strong>Example 1 - School vs. Home Values:</strong> In school, I was encouraged to question authority and express my own opinions. At home, I was expected to show respect and sometimes follow what older people said. This created confusion about which way was "right." I learned that both have value in different situations.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example 2 - Language Switching:</strong> Sometimes I think in English or German, then translate to Dari when speaking to family. This makes me feel disconnected from the deep feelings that come with thinking in your cultural language. I worry that I am losing something important.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example 3 - Cultural Explanations:</strong> When friends who are not Afghan ask about my culture, I sometimes have trouble explaining traditions or values. I understand them naturally but have not learned the historical or cultural reasons behind them. This makes me feel like an "incomplete" Afghan.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example 4 - Belonging:</strong> In Germany, I was "the Afghan kid." In Qatar, I am part of a diverse international community where many people have mixed cultural backgrounds. Sometimes I feel like I do not fully belong to any single cultural group, which can be lonely.</p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h3>Emotional Impact</h3>
                    <p><strong>Pressure:</strong> There is pressure to "represent" Afghan culture well, especially when people have limited knowledge or wrong ideas about Afghanistan. I feel responsible for showing a positive, accurate image of my culture.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pride:</strong> Despite challenges, I feel proud of my Afghan heritage. Learning about the rich history, literature, and traditions makes me appreciate what my ancestors kept and passed down.</p>
                    <p><strong>Loss:</strong> There is a feeling of loss. I did not experience Afghanistan directly. I miss cultural knowledge that would come naturally from living there. I feel like I am experiencing a "second-hand" version of my culture.</p>
                    <p><strong>Balance:</strong> The ongoing challenge is finding balance. I need to keep my Afghan identity while being open to other cultures, preserve traditions while allowing changes, and honor the past while living in the present.</p>

                    <h3>How These Challenges Shaped My Thinking</h3>
                    <p>These challenges made me realize that cultural identity is not fixed or pure. It is dynamic and can exist in mixed forms. I learned that being Afghan while living abroad does not make me "less Afghan." Instead, it creates a unique form of Afghan identity that includes adaptation and change.</p>
                    <p>This project helped me understand that the challenges themselves are valuable. They forced me to actively work with my culture instead of just receiving it. This active work, while difficult, gave me a deeper appreciation and understanding than I might have had if I simply grew up in Afghanistan without questioning my identity.</p>
                    <p>Most importantly, I learned that preserving culture is not about freezing it in time. It is about keeping its core values and meanings while allowing it to change. This understanding reduced my worry about "losing" my culture and increased my confidence in my ability to preserve and pass it on.</p>
