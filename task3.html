                    <h3>Conversations with My Parents</h3>
                    <p>I spoke with my mother about how culture was passed to her. She explained that growing up in Saudi Arabia, her parents (my grandparents) made a conscious effort to maintain Afghan traditions. They would gather with other Afghan families in the community, celebrate Afghan holidays, and always speak Dari at home.</p>
                    <p>My father shared similar experiences, noting that even though they were far from Afghanistan, his parents ensured he understood his roots through stories, food, and language. They would tell him about life in Afghanistan—the mountains, the cities, the traditions—creating a connection to a place he had never visited.</p>

                            <p>We celebrate the Persian New Year with a traditional haft-sin table, wearing new clothes, and visiting family. This tradition connects us to both Afghan and broader Persian cultural heritage.</p>

                    <h3>Specific Examples from My Household</h3>
                    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Every Friday, we have a family dinner where traditional Afghan dishes are served. This isn't just about food—it's a time for family connection, sharing stories, and maintaining our cultural practices.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> When guests visit, my parents always offer tea and sweets first, following the Afghan tradition of mehman nawazi (hospitality). This has been so ingrained that I do it automatically, even with non-Afghan friends.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> My grandmother has a collection of Afghan poetry books in Dari. She reads from them occasionally, and these poems carry cultural values, historical references, and linguistic beauty that connect us to Afghan literary tradition.</p>
