                    <h3>Conversations with My Parents</h3>
                    <p>I talked with my mother about how she learned about culture. She told me that when she grew up in Saudi Arabia, her parents (my grandparents) worked hard to keep Afghan traditions. They met with other Afghan families, celebrated Afghan holidays, and always spoke Dari at home.</p>
                    <p>My father had similar experiences. Even though they were far from Afghanistan, his parents made sure he understood where he came from. They told him stories about Afghanistan, about the mountains, the cities, and the traditions. This created a connection to a place he never visited.</p>

                            <p>We celebrate both Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha with special prayers, family gatherings, traditional foods, and giving to people who need help. This keeps the religious and cultural parts of these holidays alive.</p>

                    <h3>Specific Examples from My Household</h3>
                    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Every Friday, we have a family dinner with traditional Afghan dishes. This is not just about food. It is a time for family to connect, share stories, and keep our cultural practices alive.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> When guests visit, my parents always offer tea and sweets first. This follows the Afghan tradition of mehman nawazi (hospitality). I do this automatically now, even with friends who are not Afghan.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> My grandmother has a collection of Afghan poetry books in Dari. She reads from them sometimes. These poems have cultural values, historical stories, and beautiful language that connect us to Afghan literary tradition.</p>
