                    <h3>What I Can Do Personally in the Future</h3>
                    <p><strong>Language:</strong> I commit to improving my Dari fluency by reading Afghan literature, watching Dari-language media, and making a conscious effort to think and express complex ideas in Dari, not just basic conversation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Documentation:</strong> I will record my grandparents' stories, create a family history document, and preserve recipes and traditions in writing and video. This project itself is a step in this direction.</p>
                    <p><strong>Education:</strong> I will actively learn about Afghan history, literature, and culture through books, documentaries, and online resources. Understanding the "why" behind traditions will help me preserve them meaningfully.</p>
                    <p><strong>Teaching:</strong> When I have children, I will pass on the language, traditions, and values I've learned. I'll also share my culture with friends and community members, helping to preserve it through teaching.</p>
                    <p><strong>Community Building:</strong> I will seek out and contribute to Afghan communities wherever I live, helping to create spaces where culture can be maintained and shared.</p>
                    <p><strong>Adaptation with Preservation:</strong> I will find ways to adapt traditions to new contexts while maintaining their core meaning, ensuring they remain relevant and sustainable.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Original Learning Goal</h3>
                    <p>My learning goal was to develop a thorough and meaningful understanding of my cultural background, especially the Afghan origins of my ancestors. Through this project, I've learned that understanding isn't passive—it requires active engagement, questioning, and documentation.</p>
                    <p>The practical actions I've identified aren't separate from understanding—they're how understanding is achieved and maintained. By committing to language learning, documentation, education, and teaching, I'm ensuring that my understanding continues to deepen and that I can preserve and pass on what I've learned.</p>
                    <p>This project has shown me that cultural preservation is a responsibility I can and must take on. It's not just about my personal identity—it's about honoring my ancestors, maintaining a connection to a rich cultural heritage, and ensuring that future generations can access this knowledge and identity.</p>
