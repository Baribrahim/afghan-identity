                    <h3>What I Understood Before Starting</h3>
                    <p>Before this project, I understood my Afghan identity as something I inherited but didn't fully comprehend. I knew I was Afghan because my family was Afghan, I spoke some Dari, and we ate Afghan food. But I didn't understand the deeper meanings, the historical context, or the ways in which my identity was both preserved and transformed by living abroad.</p>
                    <p>I saw my cultural identity as somewhat fragmented—pieces of Afghan culture mixed with German and Qatari influences, without a clear understanding of how these pieces fit together or what they meant. I worried that by not living in Afghanistan, I was experiencing a "lesser" version of my culture.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-card highlight">
                    <h3>What I Understand Now</h3>
                    <p>Now I understand that cultural identity is not about geographical location but about values, practices, and connections that can be maintained and adapted across contexts. I've learned that my Afghan identity is not "lesser" because I live abroad—it's simply different, with its own unique strengths and challenges.</p>
                    <p>I understand that culture is not static—it evolves and adapts, and this evolution doesn't mean loss but rather demonstrates that the culture is alive and relevant. The adaptations my family has made—celebrating Nowruz in Qatar, maintaining traditions in smaller family units, mixing languages—are not compromises but evidence of cultural resilience.</p>
                    <p>Most importantly, I understand that cultural preservation is an active process that requires intention, learning, and commitment. It's not something that happens automatically, especially when living outside the cultural homeland. This understanding has shifted my perspective from passive recipient to active participant in cultural preservation.</p>

                    <h3>How This Project Changed My Identity Awareness</h3>
                    <p>This project has transformed my relationship with my Afghan identity. Before, it was something I took for granted or sometimes felt conflicted about. Now, I feel a sense of ownership and responsibility toward it.</p>
                    <p>The process of researching, documenting, and reflecting has made me more aware of the richness of my cultural heritage. Learning about the meanings behind traditions, the values embedded in language, and the ways my family has preserved culture has given me a deeper appreciation and pride in my identity.</p>
                    <p>I've also become more aware of the challenges and complexities of maintaining cultural identity abroad. Rather than seeing these as problems, I now understand them as part of the unique experience of diaspora identity—something that many people share and navigate.</p>
                    <p>This awareness has made me more intentional about my cultural practices. I'm no longer just going through the motions of cultural traditions—I'm understanding their significance and choosing to maintain them with purpose.</p>

                    <h3>Evaluation: Did I Achieve My Learning Goal?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, I believe I have achieved my learning goal of developing a thorough and meaningful understanding of my cultural background, especially the Afghan origins of my ancestors. However, I've also learned that this understanding is not a destination but an ongoing journey.</p>
                    <p>Through this project, I've gained:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A deeper understanding of what Afghan identity means to me personally</li>
                        <li>Knowledge of how my family has preserved culture across generations and countries</li>
                        <li>Appreciation for the role of language, food, traditions, and values in cultural identity</li>
                        <li>Recognition of the challenges and opportunities of maintaining identity abroad</li>
                        <li>A sense of personal responsibility for cultural preservation</li>
                        <li>Practical strategies for continuing to learn and preserve my cultural heritage</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>But I've also learned that there's always more to discover. My understanding will continue to deepen as I learn more about Afghan history, improve my language skills, and engage more with my cultural heritage. This project has given me the foundation and tools to continue this learning journey throughout my life.</p>
                    <p>Most importantly, this project has transformed my relationship with my cultural identity from something inherited and somewhat confusing to something understood, appreciated, and actively maintained. This transformation is the true achievement of my learning goal.</p>
