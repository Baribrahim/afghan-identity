                    <h3>What I Understood Before Starting</h3>
                    <p>Before this project, I understood my Afghan identity as something I got from my family but did not fully understand. I knew I was Afghan because my family was Afghan, I spoke some Dari, and we ate Afghan food. But I did not understand the deeper meanings, the historical reasons, or the ways my identity was both kept and changed by living abroad.</p>
                    <p>I saw my cultural identity as somewhat broken into pieces. Pieces of Afghan culture mixed with German and Qatari influences, without a clear understanding of how these pieces fit together or what they meant. I worried that by not living in Afghanistan, I was experiencing a "lesser" version of my culture.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-card highlight">
                    <h3>What I Understand Now</h3>
                    <p>Now I understand that cultural identity is not about where you live but about values, practices, and connections that can be kept and changed for different situations. I learned that my Afghan identity is not "lesser" because I live abroad. It is simply different, with its own unique strengths and challenges.</p>
                    <p>I understand that culture is not fixed. It changes and adapts, and this change does not mean loss. Instead, it shows that the culture is alive and relevant. The changes my family made, like celebrating Eid in Qatar, keeping traditions in smaller family groups, and mixing languages, are not compromises. They are proof of cultural strength.</p>
                    <p>Most importantly, I understand that cultural preservation is an active process that requires intention, learning, and commitment. It is not something that happens automatically, especially when living outside the cultural homeland. This understanding changed my perspective from passive receiver to active participant in cultural preservation.</p>

                    <h3>How This Project Changed My Identity Awareness</h3>
                    <p>This project changed my relationship with my Afghan identity. Before, it was something I took for granted or sometimes felt confused about. Now, I feel a sense of ownership and responsibility toward it.</p>
                    <p>The process of researching, documenting, and reflecting made me more aware of how rich my cultural heritage is. Learning about the meanings behind traditions, the values in language, and the ways my family kept culture gave me a deeper appreciation and pride in my identity.</p>
                    <p>I also became more aware of the challenges and complexities of keeping cultural identity abroad. Instead of seeing these as problems, I now understand them as part of the unique experience of diaspora identity. This is something that many people share and work through.</p>
                    <p>This awareness made me more intentional about my cultural practices. I am no longer just doing cultural traditions without thinking. I am understanding their importance and choosing to keep them with purpose.</p>

                <div class="content-card highlight">
                    <h3>Evaluation: Did I Achieve My Learning Goal?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, I believe I achieved my learning goal of developing a good and meaningful understanding of my cultural background, especially the Afghan origins of my ancestors. However, I also learned that this understanding is not a destination but an ongoing journey.</p>
                    <p>Through this project, I've gained:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A deeper understanding of what Afghan identity means to me personally</li>
                        <li>Knowledge of how my family has preserved culture across generations and countries</li>
                        <li>Appreciation for the role of language, food, traditions, and values in cultural identity</li>
                        <li>Recognition of the challenges and opportunities of maintaining identity abroad</li>
                        <li>A sense of personal responsibility for cultural preservation</li>
                        <li>Practical strategies for continuing to learn and preserve my cultural heritage</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>But I also learned that there is always more to discover. My understanding will continue to grow as I learn more about Afghan history, improve my language skills, and work more with my cultural heritage. This project gave me the foundation and tools to continue this learning journey throughout my life.</p>
                    <p>Most importantly, this project changed my relationship with my cultural identity from something I got from my family and was somewhat confusing to something I understand, appreciate, and actively keep. This change is the true achievement of my learning goal.</p>
