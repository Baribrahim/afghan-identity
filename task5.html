                    <h3>When and Why These Foods Are Prepared</h3>
                    <p><strong>Special Occasions:</strong> Qabuli palaw is prepared for Eid celebrations, family gatherings, and when hosting important guests. It's considered a dish of honor and celebration.</p>
                    <p><strong>Weekly Traditions:</strong> Every Friday, we have a family dinner where traditional dishes are served. This creates a regular space for cultural practice and family bonding.</p>
                    <p><strong>Religious Holidays:</strong> During Eid, my mother and grandmother spend days preparing various traditional dishes, turning cooking into a family activity that brings everyone together.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cultural Celebrations:</strong> Nowruz is marked with specific foods like boulanee and haft mewa (seven fruits), connecting food directly to cultural and seasonal celebrations.</p>

                    <h3>Cultural Meaning of Food</h3>
                    <p><strong>Hospitality:</strong> Preparing and sharing food is the primary way my family shows hospitality. When guests arrive, food is immediately offered, and refusing is considered impolite. This reflects the Afghan value of mehman nawazi.</p>
                    <p><strong>Celebration:</strong> Special dishes mark important moments—birthdays, achievements, religious holidays. Food becomes a way of honoring occasions and people.</p>
                    <p><strong>Family Connection:</strong> Cooking together, especially with my grandmother, is a way of learning and preserving traditions. Recipes aren't just written down—they're passed through demonstration and shared experience.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cultural Identity:</strong> Eating Afghan food regularly, even while living abroad, is a tangible way of maintaining connection to our cultural heritage. The smells, tastes, and preparation methods connect us to generations of Afghan cooks.</p>

                    <h3>Cooking and Eating Together as Cultural Acts</h3>
                    <p>When my grandmother teaches me to make mantu, she's not just teaching me a recipe. She's sharing stories about when she learned it, how her mother made it, and the occasions when it was served. The kitchen becomes a space of intergenerational cultural transmission.</p>
                    <p>Family meals are never rushed. They're times for conversation, sharing news, discussing problems, and reinforcing family bonds. This practice of eating together, taking time for meals, and using them as social occasions is itself a cultural practice that differs from the fast-paced eating habits I see in some other cultures.</p>
