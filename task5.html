                    <h3>When and Why These Foods Are Prepared</h3>
                    <p><strong>Special Occasions:</strong> We make qabuli palaw for Eid celebrations, family gatherings, and when we have important guests. It is a dish of honor and celebration.</p>
                    <p><strong>Weekly Traditions:</strong> Every Friday, we have a family dinner with traditional dishes. This creates a regular time for cultural practice and family bonding.</p>
                    <p><strong>Religious Holidays:</strong> During Eid, my mother and grandmother spend days preparing different traditional dishes. Cooking becomes a family activity that brings everyone together.</p>

                    <h3>Cultural Meaning of Food</h3>
                    <p><strong>Hospitality:</strong> Preparing and sharing food is the main way my family shows hospitality. When guests arrive, we offer food immediately. Refusing food is considered impolite. This shows the Afghan value of mehman nawazi.</p>
                    <p><strong>Celebration:</strong> Special dishes mark important moments like birthdays, achievements, and religious holidays. Food becomes a way of honoring special occasions and people.</p>
                    <p><strong>Family Connection:</strong> Cooking together, especially with my grandmother, is a way of learning and keeping traditions. Recipes are not just written down. They are passed through showing and shared experience.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cultural Identity:</strong> Eating Afghan food regularly, even while living abroad, is a real way of staying connected to our cultural heritage. The smells, tastes, and ways of preparing food connect us to generations of Afghan cooks.</p>

                    <h3>Cooking and Eating Together as Cultural Acts</h3>
                    <p>When my grandmother teaches me to make mantu, she is not just teaching me a recipe. She shares stories about when she learned it, how her mother made it, and when it was served. The kitchen becomes a place where culture is passed from one generation to the next.</p>
                    <p>Family meals are never rushed. They are times for conversation, sharing news, discussing problems, and making family bonds stronger. Eating together, taking time for meals, and using them as social occasions is itself a cultural practice. This is different from the fast eating habits I see in some other cultures.</p>
