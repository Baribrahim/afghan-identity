                    <h3>How Traditions Have Changed</h3>
                    <p><strong>Nowruz:</strong> In Afghanistan, Nowruz might involve larger community celebrations and public events. For us, it's more intimate—family-focused, with the haft-sin table at home. We've adapted it to our smaller family unit while maintaining core elements.</p>
                    <p><strong>Eid Celebrations:</strong> Without a large Afghan community nearby, our Eid celebrations are smaller and more family-centered. However, we've connected with other Afghan families in Qatar, creating a small community that celebrates together.</p>
                    <p><strong>Language:</strong> Some traditions that were once explained in Dari are now sometimes explained in a mix of languages, especially for younger family members who are more comfortable in English.</p>

                    <h3>Impact on Sense of Belonging</h3>
                    <p>Celebrating traditions abroad creates a complex sense of belonging. On one hand, maintaining these traditions makes me feel connected to my Afghan heritage and family. On the other hand, the adaptations and smaller scale sometimes make me feel like I'm experiencing a "watered down" version of the culture.</p>
                    <p>However, I've come to realize that adaptation doesn't mean loss—it means the culture is alive and evolving. My family's way of celebrating Nowruz in Qatar is still authentically Afghan, just adapted to our circumstances. This has taught me that cultural identity isn't about perfectly replicating traditions, but about maintaining their meaning and significance while adapting to new contexts.</p>
                    <p>The challenge is balancing between preserving authenticity and adapting to practical realities. This tension itself has become part of my identity—I'm Afghan, but I'm also someone who has learned to maintain that identity across different countries and contexts.</p>
