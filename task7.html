                    <h3>Real Examples of These Values in Action</h3>
                    <p><strong>Hospitality Example:</strong> When a friend from school came to our house for the first time, my mother immediately prepared tea and snacks, even though it was not planned. She insisted the friend stay for dinner. I could see how this made my friend feel truly welcomed. This was not just politeness. It was a cultural practice so normal for us that it happened automatically.</p>
                    <p><strong>Respect for Elders Example:</strong> When my grandparents visit, we all change our schedules to spend time with them. My parents always ask them about important family decisions. We use formal words (shoma instead of tu) when speaking to them. Even when I disagree with something they say, I must express disagreement respectfully.</p>
                    <p><strong>Family Unity Example:</strong> When my cousin in another country needed financial help for university, my parents did not hesitate to help, even though it meant we had less money. This was not seen as a burden but as a natural family responsibility.</p>
                    <p><strong>Perseverance Example:</strong> When I had trouble adapting to a new school in Qatar, my father shared stories about how my grandparents adapted when they moved from Afghanistan to Saudi Arabia. The message was clear: challenges must be faced with patience and determination, not avoided.</p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h3>Comparison with Values in Host Countries</h3>
                    <p><strong>Germany:</strong> German culture values independence and being direct. I like these qualities, but the Afghan emphasis on family interdependence and indirect communication (to keep harmony) sometimes created cultural problems. For example, in German schools, individual achievement was important, while at home, family success was more important than individual success.</p>
                    <p><strong>Qatar:</strong> Qatari culture shares some similarities with Afghan culture, like respect for elders, hospitality, and family importance. However, the specific ways of showing these are different. This made it easier to keep Afghan values here because there is less cultural conflict. But it also made me more aware of what is unique about Afghan values.</p>

                    <h3>Which Values Guide My Behavior Most</h3>
                    <p>Family unity and respect for elders are the values that most strongly guide my daily behavior. I naturally put family needs first and keep close relationships with extended family, even when it requires personal sacrifice. The respect for elders has become so normal for me that I automatically change my language and behavior around older people, no matter their cultural background.</p>
                    <p>However, I also learned to balance these values with the independence and individual achievement valued in Western education systems. This balance, keeping Afghan values while adapting to different cultural situations, is something I am still learning about through this project.</p>
