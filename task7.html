                    <h3>Real Examples of These Values in Action</h3>
                    <p><strong>Hospitality Example:</strong> When a friend from school came to our house for the first time, my mother immediately prepared tea and snacks, even though it was an unplanned visit. She insisted the friend stay for dinner, and I could see how this made my friend feel truly welcomed. This wasn't just politeness—it was a cultural practice so ingrained that it happened automatically.</p>
                    <p><strong>Respect for Elders Example:</strong> When my grandparents visit, we all adjust our schedules to spend time with them. My parents always consult them on important family decisions, and we use formal address (shoma instead of tu) when speaking to them. Even when I disagree with something they say, I'm expected to express disagreement respectfully.</p>
                    <p><strong>Family Unity Example:</strong> When my cousin in another country needed financial help for university, my parents didn't hesitate to contribute, even though it meant tightening our own budget. This wasn't seen as a burden but as a natural family responsibility.</p>
                    <p><strong>Perseverance Example:</strong> When I struggled with adapting to a new school in Qatar, my father shared stories about how my grandparents adapted when they moved from Afghanistan to Saudi Arabia. The message was clear: challenges are to be faced with patience and determination, not avoided.</p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h3>Comparison with Values in Host Countries</h3>
                    <p><strong>Germany:</strong> German culture values independence and directness. While I appreciate these qualities, the Afghan emphasis on family interdependence and indirect communication (to maintain harmony) sometimes created cultural friction. For example, in German schools, individual achievement was emphasized, while at home, family success was more important than individual success.</p>
                    <p><strong>Qatar:</strong> Qatari culture shares some similarities with Afghan culture—respect for elders, hospitality, family importance. However, the specific expressions differ. This has made it easier to maintain Afghan values here, as there's less cultural conflict, but it's also made me more aware of the unique aspects of Afghan values.</p>

                    <h3>Which Values Guide My Behavior Most</h3>
                    <p>Family unity and respect for elders are the values that most strongly guide my daily behavior. I find myself naturally prioritizing family needs and maintaining close relationships with extended family, even when it requires personal sacrifice. The respect for elders has become so internalized that I automatically adjust my language and behavior around older people, regardless of their cultural background.</p>
                    <p>However, I've also learned to balance these values with the independence and individual achievement valued in Western education systems. This balance—maintaining Afghan values while adapting to different cultural contexts—is something I'm still navigating and learning about through this project.</p>
